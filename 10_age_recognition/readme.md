# Age recognition by photo

**Task:**

- Build a machine learning model that determines the approximate age of a person by photo having trained it on set of photos of people with an indication of their age.

**Description:**

- A supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process customer images. Photo-fixing in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to shoppers of that age group and also control the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.
The model was trained on a separate GPU and had to be passed as a function. 

**Used Libraries:**

- Pandas, TesorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
