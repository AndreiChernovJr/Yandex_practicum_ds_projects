# Bank Churn Prediction

**Task:**

- Build a model that will predict if the client is about to leave the bank.

**Description:**

- Clients started leaving the bank every month. It's cheaper to keep a client then bring in a new one so the predictions were important. The probability of the client leaving the bank in the near future was predicted. Prediction model was built with subsequent verification on a test sample. The F1 metric has been brought to 0.63. Additionally measured AUC-ROC. Dealing with unbalanced data through upsampling.

**Used Libraries:**

- Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib
