# Car Price Prediction Model :car: :money_with_wings:

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Model project on GitHub! This repository contains the code and resources for defining the optimal price of used cars. The application utilizes historical data with technical characteristics and configurations to predict car prices.

## Project Overview :rocket:

In the fast-paced world of used car sales, accurate and speedy price predictions are crucial for providing excellent service to customers. This project aims to build a robust car price prediction model with the following key objectives:

1. **Prediction Quality:** The model's primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting car prices. It has undergone rigorous testing and optimization to ensure reliable results.

2. **Prediction Speed:** In addition to accuracy, the model is designed for fast predictions, enabling quick responses to user queries and enhancing user experience.

3. **Studying Time:** The project has been developed with a focus on efficient learning algorithms and methodologies to reduce studying time and enhance model performance.

## Key Model Estimator: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) :bar_chart:

The model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), a widely-used metric for regression problems. The target is to achieve an RMSE value below 2500, indicating a reasonably low prediction error.

## Contents :open_file_folder:

The repository is organized as follows:

- `autos.csv/`: Contains the historical data used for training and testing the model.
- `car_price_rus.ipyb/`: Jupyter notebook showcasing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation processes in russian as it was originally created.
- `car_price_naked_eng.ipyb/`: Jupyter notebook with same code, headings in english and deleted text blocks for more convenient code review.
