# Drilling Locations Estimation

**Task:**

- Build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit with the least risk of loss.

**Description:**

- The oil company needs to decide where to drill a new oil well. We were provided with oil samples in three regions: in each 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. I built a machine learning model to help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. I also analysed the possible profit and risks using the Bootstrap technique.

**Used Libraries:**

- Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Bootstrap
